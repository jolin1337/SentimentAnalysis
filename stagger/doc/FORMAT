    CoNLL-X based annotated data format


1   Word index (1-based, within sentence)
2   Word form
3   Lemma (empty string if not available)
4   POS tag (coarse), or "_"
5   POS tag (fine-grained -- identical to above, ignored in input) or "_"
6   Morphological features or "_"
7   Head or "_"
8   Dependency type or "_"
9   Chunk tag (B, I, O) or "_"
10  Chunk type (corpus-specific)
11  NE tag (B, I, O) or "_"
12  NE type (corpus-specific)
13  Token ID

* Token ID can be arbitrary, but I use the convention of colon-separated
  strings with the first value being the highest-level source. For instance,
  token 3 in sentence 5 in document xyz could be encoded as  xyz:5:3
* Most fields use a single underscore ("_") to denote a missing value, but
  column 3 should use an empty string.
